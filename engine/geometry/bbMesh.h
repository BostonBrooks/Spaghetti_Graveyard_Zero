 * @brief mesh gives a height value for each vertex of the grid of tiles that
 * make up the ground surface. A mesh will also be used to give weightings to
 * different textures being blended to draw the ground surface
 * mesh provides enough padding to use Lanczos interpolation and Gaussian
 * differential interpolation. out-of-bound access returns some default value.
