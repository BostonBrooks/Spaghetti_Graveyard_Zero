/**
 * @file
 * @brief I use a lot of double-ly linked lists
 *
 * what can you do with a list?
 *
 * - push and pop left and right
 * - push and pop left and right but the list remains sorted
 * - iterate back and forth through the list.
 * - reset the iterator
 * - access the object pointed to by the iterator
 * - pop the object pointed to by the iterator
 * - after modifying object, sort back into list
 *
 * - insert object before or after another object, including the one pointed
 * to by iterator
 *
 * NOTE: if you take the object pointed to by the iterator, modify it, sort it
 * back in to the list, then continue iterating through the list, you might
 * come across the same object again! its not too big of a problem, but might
 * need to guard against
 *
 * compare had better return > or < and never ==
 * ie if A < B iff B > A
 *
 *
 * As a rule, try not to move or remove current from list,
 * bbWarning
