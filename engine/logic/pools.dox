/** \page Pools

    There are a few different options for storing objects in pools<br>
<br>
    Do we want to store objects in a flat array or an array of arrays? Do we
    want to address objects by 64 bit memory locations or an index into the
    array? Do we wish to include handles with checking bits in case of
    deallocate-reallocate collisions? How much meta-information is included
    inside an object in the pool?<br>
<br>
    I propose a common interface so different kinds of pool can be implemented
    and swapped in and out on a per-system basis.<br>
<br>
    Necessary actions performed by a pool:<br>
<br>
    - create pool<br>
    - clear / delete pool<br>
    - create object<br>
    - delete object<br>
    - convert between memory address, pool index and handle<br>
<br>
    Other features that may come in handy:<br>
<br>
    - query object to find out what pool it belongs to<br>
    - query object to see what map it belongs to (we could just assume
    everything is in the same map and use thread local variables) <br>
    - query object to see what system/class it belongs to<br>
<br>
    - create object with a given handle, checking in case such an object already
    exists<br>
    - available spaces for new objects should be stored in a double-linked list
<br>
