# Spaghetti Graveyard Zero

Welcome to a new year of game development in 2026!

Note: I am using this distro as a usb drive to switch between my laptop and 
my workstation, as such this work in progress will likely not compile and 
run properly.

Spaghetti Graveyard Zero will be the Nth iteration of a project I started around the year 2018.
The project is an action RPG game that quizes you on mathematics skills (numeracy).

Spaghetti - Because I did not know much about how write well structured code at the start of this project.
Graveyard - Because since learning how to write better code, I have discarded much of the code that I had written.
Zero      - Because this is intended to the first iteration that is intended for public viewing.


Since this code is intended for public viewing, I will strive for the code to be of production quality.
As a starting point I will develop the documentation using Doxygen before implementing any functioning code.
Code will be written in the C language and attempt acheive some object oriented functionality through "clever hacks".
